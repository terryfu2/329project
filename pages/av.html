      <h1>Introduction to AntiViruses:</h1>
      <p>
        In 1971, the first computer virus known as the Creeper spread to PDP-10
        mainframe computers manufactured by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).
        To prevent this infection, An American computer programmer Ray Tomlinson
        developed something called the Reaper, which was a program to delete the
        Creeper virus. Although the Reaper was not an actual antivirus, it was
        the start of the antivirus era.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the very beginning of this research, it’s sufficient to define some
        of the definitions that I want to use through this research paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I want to define what a virus is in computers, in other words,
        what do we mean by calling something a virus?
      </p>
      <li>
        Generally, A computer virus, much like a flu virus, is designed to
        spread from hostto host and has the ability to replicate itself.
        Similarly, in the same way that viruses cannot reproduce without a host
        cell, computer viruses cannot reproduce and spread without programming
        such as a file or document.
      </li>
      <p>
        Second, I want to define what an antivirus is, in other words, what do
        we mean by calling something as an antivirus?
      </p>
      <li>
        Generally, Anti virus is a Software that is created specifically to help
        detect,prevent and remove malware/malicious software
      </li>
      <p>
        Third, I want to define what is malware or malicious software in
        computers, in other words, what do we mean by calling something
        malware/malicious software? A technical writer, Ben Lutkevich, defined
        malware or malicious software as the following term:
      </p>
      <li>
        Malware, or malicious software, is any program or file that is
        intentionallyharmful to a computer, network or server.
      </li>
      <p>
        With the definitions that I mentioned above, I think we are ready to go
        into the depth of viruses, antiviruses, and malicious softwares. Of
        course, I will try to keep it clear to help you understand better.
      </p>
      <h1>The reason of using antiviruses:</h1>
      <p>
        You may have this question on the back of your mind, what is the point
        of using antiviruses? I’m here to explain that. These days, most people
        are using the internet. Of course, using an online world via the
        internet can be so cool; but it actually can be threatening in some
        cases. For instance, when you are buying some stuff from Amazon, your
        bank information can be in danger.What will happen if somebody gets
        access to your bank information? Of course we all know that. They can
        steal all our money.
      </p>
      <p>
        As another example which is related to our topic, antivirus, have you
        ever installed an application which made your computer slow? Personally,
        I experienced that many times in my life. I can remember that when I was
        11, I installed a game which made my laptop very slow; I was scared of
        that and I asked my cousin about that, who is a senior computer
        programmer; He told me that there is a possibility that your computer
        got infected by a virus, you have to install an antivirus to find the
        virus and delete it.
      </p>
      <p>Now, it’s time to answer the following question:</p>
      <h1>Why do I need to use antiviruses?</h1>
      <li>
        As long as computers have been and will be in existence, whether
        connected to theInternet or not, there will always be a need for
        antivirus software. There will never be a time when people, whether
        mischievous youths seeking a thrill or hardened cybercriminals looking
        to exploit billion-dollar companies, will stop looking to find ways to
        commit fraud, cause widespread damage, or just experience the rush of
        breaking into a computer.
      </li>
      <p>
        As you all may get infected by a computer virus while you are surfing on
        the internet, downloading documents from the websites, or opening a link
        which is sent by other people, it is better for you to be ready to
        prevent these viruses from infecting your computers. The easiest way to
        be prepared for that is to install an antivirus, which will be taking
        care of your computer. As I explained the advantages of using an
        antivirus above, you may be convinced that it is necessary and
        sufficient to use an antivirus.
      </p>
      <h1>Different kind of viruses:</h1>
      <p>
        At this point, it is worth mentioning what kind of viruses do we have?
      </p>
      <a href="https://vpnoverview.com/internet-safety/malware/computer-virus/">
        <img src="../res/av1.png" width="600"/>
      </a>

      <p>
        Please take a look at the picture that I attached above. By considering
        that, you will have the basic understanding of each type of computer
        virus, which is completely enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, it’s time to introduce diﬀerent kinds of antiviruses. Of course,
        there are multiple types of antiviruses that we can use to protect our
        computer from viruses, malwares and malicious softwares. Let’s take a
        look at it.
      </p>
      <h1>Diferent kind of antiviruses:</h1>
      <p>
        According to softwarelab.org, Antivirus programs can be divided into the
        following categories:
      </p>
      <li>Standalone Antivirus Software</li>
      <li>Security Software Suites</li>
      <li>Cloud-Based Antivirus Software</li>
      <p>
        At this point, I want to briefly discuss each type of the antivirus.
      </p>
      <li>Standalone Antivirus program:</li>
      <li>
        Is a specialized program designed to find and remove specific viruses.
      </li>
      <li>
        As it’s possible to be installed on a USB drive, people referred to it
        as a portable antivirus software.
      </li>
      <li>
        Although, most portable programs do not provide real-time protection.
      </li>
      <li>
        Therefore, Standalone antivirus programs do not protect properly while
        you are using the internet.
      </li>
      <p>Security Software Suites:</p>
      <li>These Security Softwares can detect and remove viruses.</li>
      <li>
        They were created in a way that they can fight all types of malicious
        softwares.
      </li>
      <li>
        They can provide round-the-clock protection, which means that they can
        protect the computer all day and all night without being interrupted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Therefore, in comparison to the standalone antivirus program, they can
        provide better protection while you are using the internet.
      </li>
      <p>Cloud-Based Antivirus Software:</p>
      <li>
        Is a new type of antivirus technology that instead of analyzing the
        files in the computer, it analyzes the files in the cloud.
      </li>
      <li>
        As it is cloud-based, it causes faster protection and reduces the used
        space in the computer.
      </li>
      <p>
        Based on the things that I mentioned above, you can choose which
        antivirus would be suitable for you; although I would recommend that you
        ignore the standalone antivirus, and get an antivirus which is a
        cloud-based or security software suite. By considering these kinds of
        antivirus, I want to discuss how we can use antiviruses. Should we have
        a great knowledge about computers to be able to use antivirus?
      </p>
      <h1>How can we use antiviruses:</h1>
      <img src="../res/av2.png" width="700"/>
      <li>
        I took the first photo by myself, from my own antivirus called TotalAv
        which is installed on my system.
      </li>
      <li>The second photo is for the Kaspersky website, kaspersky.com</li>
      <p>
        By considering the photos that I attached above, you can figure out that
        using an antivirus is pretty painless and uncomplicated. All the
        antiviruses have the “scan” button on their application, which you can
        simply push. Once you push the button, the scan will start shortly.
        After the termination of the scan, the results of the scan will be shown
        up, you can delete them from your system pretty easily, only with
        pushing the delete button.
      </p>
      <p>
        By considering all the things that I have explained until now, you are
        more than ready to hear about the functionality of an antivirus in a
        pretty simple way.
      </p>
      <h1>How do Antiviruses work?</h1>
      <p>
        According to the Dotnek website, antivirus monitors all the changes that
        occur in the files. Based on the suspicious cases, antivirus can notice
        the presence of threatening factors and send warning messages to the
        user, the antivirus works quickly and detects the threats, and it
        destroys the threats.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the Verizon website, most antivirus programs will use the
        following detection devices:
      </p>
      <li>Specific detection: Detects the known malware</li>
      <li>
        Generic detection: Detects by looking for known parts or types of
        malwares andpatterns that are related to each other.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heuristic detection: Detects by scanning for unknown viruses by
        recognizing
      </li>
      <p>
        known suspicious file structures. When the program finds the file which
        contains the virus, it will quarantine it and mark it for deletion.
        Also, it makes it inaccessible
      </p>
      <p>
        As a conclusion for the functionality of the antivirus, an antivirus
        software will search for the viruses, it will detect them, and then it
        will remove them from the system. Of course, the functionality of an
        antivirus is way more complicated than this, but as a non-computer savvy
        individual, this explanation is appropriate for you to have the basic
        understanding of the functionality of an antivirus.
      </p>

        <img src="../res/av3.png" width="1000" />
      </a>

      <p>
        At this moment, it’s time to talk about which antivirus is appropriate
        to get the maximum protection. Of course, you all have this question. It
        is worth mentioning that our recommendation is not the best possible
        choice, you can search about it and find your favorite antivirus which
        meets your requirements in a way that satisfies you and matches with
        your ideal price range.
      </p>
      <h1>Which Antivirus should we use:</h1>
      <p>
        According to the Antivirus Software Guide website, The best 10
        antiviruses in 2022 are the following antiviruses:
      </p>
      <img src="../res/av4.png" width="500" />
      <p>
        Don’t forget to consider that a free antivirus might not be able to
        fully protect your system from malwares and viruses. It is worth knowing
        that best antiviruses can be available with a great discount which makes
        the price reasonable. Some of the antiviruses will protect your
        smartphones, smart television, and tablets as well. Furthermore, don’t
        forget to consider the effectiveness against cyber threats. Consider the
        performance of it and the features which are provided by an antivirus.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, antivirus’s market is extremely competitive. There are a
        bunch of famous antivirus companies in the market. Of course, choosing
        an appropriate antivirus can be a hard decision to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the day, I want to mention that you are the best person
        who can protect yourself from any suspicious activity and malwares.
        Because it does not matter how good your antivirus is, if you are not
        careful and responsible for your personal data and information, stealing
        your information would be actually possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, I want to make a quiz for you to help you understand better.
        Also, you can always review the information that we covered in this
        research paper by doing this quiz. Your grade will be reported to you as
        soon as you finish answering the question.
