    <h1> Intoduction to Passwords</h1><br>
    <br><strong>What is a password??</strong><br>
    It's a secret word or phrase that helps you get onto an app,website or device.<br>
    <br><strong>Why do we need to have strong passwords?</strong><br>
    It stops other people getting into your accounts online, accessing your personal information,<br>
    and other stuff that you might have in there.<br>
    <br> <strong>Is it a good idea to put your personal information into your password?</strong><br>
    NO, it is not a good idea, beacuse that information is easy for others to guess<br>
    <br> <strong> What does a strong password look like?</strong><br>
    It can be a word, a  phrase, or a sentence.<br>
    It's long and has capital letters, small letters, numbers, and special characters<br>
    They are easy for you to remember, but not easy for others to guess!<br>
    <br><strong>Where can you store your passwords in case you forget them?</strong><br>
    Many devices have ‘autofill passwords’ – it asks if you would like for your password to be stored for the next time you need to log on.
    <br>Tell a guardian or parent who can keep them safe for you. (This is also useful in case you forget)
    <br> You could use a Password Manager; to set this up, you would need a grown up to help you. This is useful if you have many passwords. A Password Manager stores and manages your passwords for you.
    <br>Write them down and put them in a safe place in your home.
    <br><br><strong>What could haooen if you share your passwords with other people?</strong>
    <br>They could pretend to be you, use your account, change your profile, change your privacy settings, and perhaps share/post or comment online. This then looks as if you did those things.
    <br>That would be very upsetting for you, it could hurt other people, it could be dangerous, and you might get into a lot of trouble. Perhaps some children can share examples of this from their experience.

    <h1>How to create a secure password</h1>
    When carefully created and protected, strong passwords increase safe and secure interactions online and can prevent password cracking. To maximize the strength and efficacy of passwords, organizations often establish password policies. These policies are designed to help users create strong passwords and adopt best practices for managing login credentials. 
    <br>Below are a few examples of the practices that contribute to effective password management and creation:
    <br><br>
    1. A minimum length of eight characters and a maximum between 16 to 64 characters.<br>
    2. Include both uppercase and lowercase letters with various case sensitivity. This increases the number of variables at play,
    and therefore, its difficulty<br>
    3. Use at east one number <br>
    4. Use at least one special character <br>
    5. Avoid using easily guessed elements such as names of children, pets or birthdays<br>
    6. Consider using a password management tool <br>
    
    <h1>How to avoid weak passwords</h1><br>
    Users and businesses should strive to eliminate common password vulnerabilities that threat actors tend to look for. With social media being more present than ever before, any recognizable personal information can be easily obtained by a persistent cybercriminal. Common weaknesses include:<br>
    - Use of the word "password" <br><br>
    - Sequential numbers starting from one, such as "12345678"  <br><br>
    - Inclusion of accessible information: birthdates, names of relatives, home addresses and names of pets or children <br><br>

    <h1>How often should passwords be changed?</h1> <br>
    Strong passwords don't just depend on the code or the individual; they also depend on the expiration date. Corporate password policies often place an expiration date on their users' passcodes, forcing users to replace old passwords with new ones. Password time periods commonly span 90 to 180 days. Sophisticated password creation systems may also force users to create new passwords that don't share major similarities to their previous iterations.<br>
    <h1>Password Managers</h1><br>
    The best way to store your passwords is by using a password manager. They allow you to store your passwords in a file or in the cloud and protect them with a single master password. That way, you will only have to remember one strong password, which lets you access the rest of them.
